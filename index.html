                A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the cultivation, display, 
                and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. The single feature identifying even 
                the wildest wild garden is control. The garden can incorporate both natural and artificial materials.
                Gardens often have design features including statuary, follies, pergolas, trellises, stumperies, dry 
                creek beds, and water features such as fountains, ponds (with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks. 
                Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while others also produce food crops, sometimes in 
                separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants.
